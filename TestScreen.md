TestScreen

Concept:
Use HTML5 to create Dynamic Test Screens, touse will be displayed via graphics card and can be safed as images. Also there shoud me templates for outputs which can be saved to textformat.

Restrictions:
Test screens should be documented, cause half screen will allways be to pixels
Multidisplay Support must be done right, templates for edge blending
