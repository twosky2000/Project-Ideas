Touchscreen

Current touchscreens have mostly a recognicable delay for input. Also object recognition would be nice

Basic Concept:
Camera on a tranclucent panel, trigometrie with infrared or rgb.


Restrictions:
Light is tricky for recognicion, Sunnlight or Bright lamps could interduce false output.
Bringing a Image on the touchscreen could interduce errors because light is input
