OPNsense_SecureHome

I want to know what's happening in my network. OPNsense is a good Project for that. But there is little dokumentation beside the official doku and some starter guides. Baybe it would be good to do my owne doku to strengthen the project.

Concept:
OPNsense report for ping google or other sites(Internet working)
Setup solide reporting
openVPN doku, isolate from not nessecery network
Doku how to segment the network, for dedecting unnormal behavior
How to segment network so they have no possibility to connect to iot devices
